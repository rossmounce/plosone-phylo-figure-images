plosone-phylo-figure-images
===========================

A separate repository dedicated to the phylo-figure-images extracted from https://github.com/rossmounce/plosonehtml

For viewing simplicity, the 156 figures in this repository are also mirrored over at Flickr:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/124252768@N08/

Flickr is a seriously interesting platform for image storage/sharing.
* The free account you get allows for 1TB of storage (yes, TB not GB).
* Easy to setup multiple accounts (one per journal or publisher perhaps?)
* It has an excellent API
* It preserves embedded EXIF image metadata.

(Original metadata is preserved both after upload (onsite) AND if you subsequently download the original image (size) from Flickr. It can also display all the EXIF metadata if you know where to click, although this isn't auto-displayed normally.

I am also exploring the use of Google Plus, although you only get 15GB space with that, and the API isn't as good.
It does however have excellent metadata preservation. The metadata is not displayed well on site though.

Here's the public Google+ album of the same PLOS ONE figure image content (156 figures):
